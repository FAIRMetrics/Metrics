### Maturity Indicator Identifier:[FM_F1_M_IdentUnique](https://w3id.org/fair-metrics/general/FM_F1_M_IdentUnique)

### Maturity Indicator Name:   Identifier Uniqueness

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
F1

### Applicable Research Domain
[Subject Agnostic]("http://www.fairsharing.org/ontology/subject/SRAO_0000401")

### Applicable Datatype
[Dataset] ("https://schema.org/Dataset")


### What is being measured?
Whether the GUID matches (regexp) a GUID scheme recognized as being globally unique by some authority (e.g. FAIRsharing).


### Why should we measure it?
The uniqueness of an identifier is a necessary condition to unambiguously refer that resource, and that resource alone. Otherwise, an identifier shared by multiple resources will confound efforts to describe that resource, or to use the identifier to retrieve it. Examples of identifier schemes include, but are not limited to URN, IRI, DOI, Handle, trustyURI, LSID, etc. For an in-depth understanding of the issues around identifiers, please see http://dx.plos.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.2001414


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
