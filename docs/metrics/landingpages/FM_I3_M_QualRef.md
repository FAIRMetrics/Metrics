### Maturity Indicator Name:   Qualified outward links

----

### To which principle does it apply?
I3

### Applicable Research Domain
[Subject Agnostic]("http://www.fairsharing.org/ontology/subject/SRAO_0000401")

### Applicable Datatype
[Dataset] ("https://schema.org/Dataset")


### What is being measured?
Does the linked data metadata contain links that are not from the same source (domain/host)

### Why should we measure it?
Data silos thwart interoperability. Thus, we should reasonably expect that some of the references/relations point outwards to other resources, owned by third-parties; this is one of the requirements for 5 star linked data.



### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
