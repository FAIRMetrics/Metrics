### Maturity Indicator Identifier:[Champ_MI_F2A](https://w3id.org/fair-metrics/general/champ-mi-f2a.ttl)

### Maturity Indicator Name:   Structured Metadata

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
F2

### What is being measured?
Whether the metadata of the record contains "structured" elements.
These may be in the form of hash-like content (micrograph, JSON),
or in one of the various forms of linked data (JSON-LD, RDFa, etc.)

### Why should we measure it?
Structured data is inherently easier for machines to accurately process and
interpret.  Even loosely structured metadata can have reliable parsers built
to consume it, including those of major search engines.  Thus, it improves
the findability of the record.



### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
