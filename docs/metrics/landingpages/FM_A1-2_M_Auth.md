----

### To which principle does it apply?  
A1.2

[Subject Agnostic]("http://www.fairsharing.org/ontology/subject/SRAO_0000401")

### Applicable Datatype

### What is being measured?
If the resolution protocol supports authentication and authorization for access to restricted content

### Why should we measure it?
Not all content can be made available without restriction. For instance, access and distribution of personal health data may be restricted by law or by organizational policy. In such cases, it is important that the protocol by which such content can be accessed is fully specified. Ideally, electronic content can be obtained first by applying for access. Once the requester is formally authorized to access the content, they may receive it in some electronic means, for instance by obtaining an download URL, or through a more sophisticated transaction mechanism (e.g. authenticate, authorize), or by any other means. The goal should be to reduce the time it takes for valid requests to be fulfilled.



### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
