### Maturity Indicator Identifier:[FM_A1-1_M_OpenProt](https://w3id.org/fair-metrics/general/FM_A1-1_M_OpenProt)

### Maturity Indicator Name: (Meta)data retrieval protocol is open

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
A1.1

### Applicable Research Domain
[Subject Agnostic]("http://www.fairsharing.org/ontology/subject/SRAO_0000401")


### Applicable Datatype
[Dataset] ("https://schema.org/Dataset")

### What is being measured?
If the resolution protocol is universally implementable with an open protocol

### Why should we measure it?
Access to a resource may be limited by the specified communication protocol. In particular, we are worried about access to technical specifications and any costs associated with implementing the protocol. Protocols that are closed source or that have royalties associated with them could prevent users from being able to obtain the resource.



### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
