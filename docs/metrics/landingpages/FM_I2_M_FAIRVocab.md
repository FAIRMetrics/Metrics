### Maturity Indicator Identifier:[FM_I2_M_FAIRVocab](https://w3id.org/fair-metrics/general/FM_I2_M_FAIRVocab)

### Maturity Indicator Name:   Uses FAIR Vocabularies

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
I2

### Applicable Research Domain
[Subject Agnostic]("http://www.fairsharing.org/ontology/subject/SRAO_0000401")

### Applicable Datatype
[Dataset] ("https://schema.org/Dataset")


### What is being measured?
If the (meta)data uses vocabularies that are, themselves, FAIR

### Why should we measure it?
It is not possible to unambiguously interpret metadata represented as simple keywords or other non-qualified symbols. For interoperability, it must be possible to identify data that can be integrated like-with-like. This requires that the data, and the provenance descriptors of the data, should (where reasonable) use vocabularies and terminologies that are, themselves, FAIR.

In this loose MI, we test only if the vocabulary terms resolve (e.g. to a human-readable page).  We do not test
if they resolve to machine-readable information.  A second Maturity Indicator (Gen2-FM-I2B) is for that stricter test.


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
