----

### To which principle does it apply?  
F4

### Applicable Research Domain
[Subject Agnostic]("http://www.fairsharing.org/ontology/subject/SRAO_0000401")

### Applicable Datatype

### What is being measured?
The degree to which the digital resource can be found using web-based search engines.

### Why should we measure it?
Most people use a search engine to initiate a search for a particular digital resource of interest.
If the resource or its metadata are not indexed by web search engines,
then this would substantially diminish an individual’s ability to find and reuse it.
Thus, the ability to discover the resource should be tested using i) its identifier,
ii) other text-based metadata.


### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
