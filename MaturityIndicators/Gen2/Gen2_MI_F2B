This process will therefore return Linked Data that can only be found using a special tool.  Therefore, passing this
Maturity Indicator does not mean that the publisher has *actively* made grounded metadata available.""";

    fairmi:measuring """Whether the metadata of the record contains \"structured\" elements that are
\"grounded\" in shared vocabularies.  For example, in one of the various forms
of linked data (JSON-LD, RDFa, Turtle, etc.)""";
    fairmi:procedure """Metadata is harvested by:
1) resolving the GUID (following all redirects) with a Content-Type header specifically searching for some form of structured data.  e.g.
   'Accept: text/turtle, application/n3, application/rdf+n3, application/turtle, application/x-turtle,text/n3,text/turtle, text/rdf+n3, text/rdf+turtle,application/json+ld, text/xhtml+xml,application/rdf+xml,application/n-triples'
2) resolving any Link 'meta' HTTP Headers (processed independently according to this same process, but not iteratively)
3) parsing the response body either as a hash (for non-linked data) or as a Graph for linked data, or both.
4) All other data is passed to the 'extruct' tool (https://github.com/scrapinghub/extruct) or to the Apache Tika tool (https://tika.apache.org/) for deep exploration
5) Any linked or hash-type data found by those tools are merged with the existing Hash or Graph data
6) The Graph is interrogated v.v. if it contains any data""";

interpret, in particular by generic agents, who are able to precisely determine the
