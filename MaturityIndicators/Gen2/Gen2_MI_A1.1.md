### Maturity Indicator Identifier: Gen2_MI_A1.1 [https://w3id.org/fair/maturity_indicator/terms/Gen2/Gen2_MI_A1.1](https://w3id.org/fair/maturity_indicator/terms/Gen2/Gen2_MI_A1.1)

### Maturity Indicator Name:   Open protocol for (meta)data retrieval

----

### To which principle does it apply?  
A1.1

### What is being measured?
If the resolution protocol is universally implementable with an open protocol

### Why should we measure it?
Access to a resource may be limited by the specified communication protocol. In particular, we are worried about access to technical specifications and any costs associated with implementing the protocol. Protocols that are closed source or that have royalties associated with them could prevent users from being able to obtain the resource.




### What must be provided for the measurement?
The Metadata GUID.


### How is the measurement executed?
The GUID (either data or metadata) is mapped to a resolution protocol.  This resolution protocol
is queried in FAIRSharing to determine if it meets the requirements of FAIRness.


### What is/are considered valid result(s)?
FAIRSharing registry says the protocol is FAIR

### For which digital resource(s) is this relevant? (or 'all')
All

### Examples of good practices (that would score well on this assessment)
